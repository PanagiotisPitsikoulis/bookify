# Main Source Directory

Core source code and resources for the Travel Agency application, structured according to Maven conventions.

## Contents

- **java/**: Java source code
- **resources/**: UI resources including FXML layouts, stylesheets, and images

## Structure Rationale

Maven's standard directory layout separates source code from resources. This separation helps with build processes and resource management.

> **Note**: Proper file organization is critical when working with JavaFX applications, as resources must be in the correct location for the application to function properly.
